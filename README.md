**Wisabi ATM Report**

**Introduction:**

This Power BI report analyzes ATM transaction data for Wisabi Bank, providing insights into customer behavior, ATM usage, and opportunities to improve services.

**Disclaimer:** This report is based on a practice dataset, creating a fictional scenario for exploration, and does not represent any actual company, institution, or country. The insights presented in this report are based on simulated ATM transaction data and are intended for demonstration purposes only. They showcase the capabilities of Power BI.

**Problem Statement:**

1. Analyze the ATM transaction data and generate reports and visualizations that show the most popular ATM locations and transaction types by time of day, day of week, and month.
2. Calculate the average transaction amount per customer and per ATM location.
3. Analyze the number of transactions and transaction amounts by customer age group, gender, and occupation.
4. Analyze the distribution of transaction types by customer type (Wisabi customers vs. customers of other banks).
5. Analyze the impact of public holidays and weekends on ATM usage and transaction patterns.
6. Analyze the frequency and amounts of transfers between accounts and between different banks.
7. Evaluate the performance of each ATM location in terms of uptime, maintenance issues, and customer satisfaction.
8. Identify outliers and anomalies in the transaction data.

**Recommendations:**

The journey doesn't end with mere observations. Let's translate our insights into action, crafting a narrative that guides Wisabi Bank towards ATM service excellence.

**Optimizing Utilization:**

- **Low-Performing ATMs:** Give them a helping hand! Increase visibility and accessibility, consider offering attractive incentives, and leverage marketing channels. Don't forget - additional services and understanding customer preferences can be game-changers.
- **High-Demand ATMs:** Let's handle the rush! Consider adding more ATMs or upgrading to faster models. Regular maintenance and minimized downtime are crucial. Analyzing usage patterns can pinpoint bottlenecks and pave the way for smoother transactions. Educating customers on efficient ATM usage can also make a big difference.

**Transaction Insights:**

- **Shifting Gears:** A high proportion of balance inquiries and transfers suggests an opportunity. Educating customers about alternative banking channels like phone banking or online platforms can be incredibly beneficial. Offering incentives for using these channels could further encourage adoption.

**Note:** Remember to replace placeholders with your actual data and visuals. Tailor the report to your specific findings and consider adding interactive elements for enhanced engagement. Regularly update the report with new data and insights.

I hope this streamlined version addresses your concerns and provides a clear structure for your Wisabi ATM Report documentation.
